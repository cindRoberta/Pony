## Arithmetic operations between real numbers and infinity

operation | Pony | Math
--------- | ---- | -----
x + ∞ | I don't know | ∞
x - ∞ | I don't know | -∞
x / ∞ | I don't know | 0
x / -∞ | I don't know | 0
x > 0 => x * ∞ | I don't know | ∞
x > 0 => x * -∞ | I don't know | -∞
x < 0 => x * ∞ | I don't know | -∞
x < 0 => x * -∞ | I don't know | ∞
